## This file describes the "server" metrics. It's used along with
## `pings.yaml`
## This defines the various allowed metrics that are to be captured.
## Each metric is written as a JSON blob to the default logger output.

  # Name (I am using the type as the name because I'm lazy. The linter complains if all
  # of the various metrics begin with the same string.)
  # This would generate a logging function containing the category and name
  # (e.g. `autotrack_event`, that takes the UA string, IP address (remote? local?), and
  # the various `string` and `quantity` fields listed below.
  # I believe you can only define one "event" which contains all the string/quantity fields
  # defined.
  some_event:
    # Metric Parameters
    type: "event"
    # The following is required and specifies when this event should be "sent",
    # metrics without this field ARE NOT WRITTEN to logs.
    # "metrics" is the default, but can include any of the `Category` specified.
    # (e.g. in this file `some_event` and `another_event`)
