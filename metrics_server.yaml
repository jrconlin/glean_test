## `pings.yaml`

## Each metric is written as a JSON blob to the default logger output.

  # Name (I am using the type as the name because I'm lazy. The linter complains if all
  # of the various metrics begin with the same string.)
  # This would generate a logging function containing the category and name
  # (e.g. `autotrack_event`, that takes the UA string, IP address (remote? local?), and
  # the various `string` and `quantity` fields listed below.
  # I believe you can only define one "event" which contains all the string/quantity fields
  # defined.
