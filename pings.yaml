## Describe the `pings` you're sending out.
## This file also does double duty as the wrapper file for server metric logging.
## The metrics for server logging are described in `metrics_server.yaml`, but are
## limited to `event`, `string`, & `quantity`.

# Schema
$schema: moz://mozilla.org/schemas/glean/pings/1-0-0

# Each group defines a discrete logging event. `event` and the field types
# in `metrics_server.yaml` are associated with these, and discrete Loggers
# are built for each.
# NOTE: A potentially empty `metrics` group will always be built since that's
# the default. It depends on if any of the `event` or field types specified indicate
# if they're included in the default `metrics` ping.

# There are no groups, well, technically, this is the group. It's
# limited to alphanum.
